      <p>Johnny Vincent Orlando or more commonly known as Johnny O, or Johnny Orlando, was born in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada on January 24th, 2003 to parents Dale and Meredith Orlando. Orlando’s father Dale Orland is a lawyer by profession while his mother Meredith Orlando is a housewife. Johnny has three sisters, Lauren Orlando, Maddie Orlando, and Darian Orlando. Orlando had always been interested in singing and songwriting as a young child. He was inspired by his two older sisters Maddie and Darian, who both sing and perform.</p>
         
      <p>In December of 2011, Orlando’s sister Darian made a YouTube channel for him called ‘JohnnyOsings’ and posted a video of him covering the song “Mistletoe”. Johnny and Darian note how they recorded it in their bathroom because of the good acoustics. This video was expected to reach only 100 views, but to their surprise, the video went viral and got around 100,000 views within the first month. Orlando and his sister continued to post more song covers of famous artists such as Taylor Swift, Rihanna, Shawn Mendes, and Justin Bieber to his YouTube channel.</p>

      <p>These videos steamrolled Johnny’s career to release more original songs and not just covers, Orlando released his first album in 2016 called “Let Go”, which was quite popular at the time. In 2017 Orlando attended the Local High School in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, completing his high school education in 2021. Johnny now attends McGill University in Toronto but is still producing and making music.</p>
